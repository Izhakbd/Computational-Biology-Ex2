# Instructions:

First, select the matrix size from a select menu (the suggested sizes are 3,5,4,8 only).

Then, under inheritance Mode, you must choose whether you want to run the regular, Darwinian, or Lamarckian genetic algorithm 

("None" represents a regular genetic algorithm).

You can choose also the elitism option. (not must)

if selected, a message "Using Elitism" will be displayed.

**Now you can click start and the algorithm will start running.** 

After clicking start, the graph showing the fitness variation over the generations will be displayed on the right, and the current generation number, the optimal solution found so far, and its fitness will be displayed on the left

You can click stop at any stage and stop the algorithm from running.

### Note!
If a matrix size of 4/8 is selected, A pop-up screen will be displayed asking are you interested in finding a Perfect magic square. 

**The question will only be displayed *after* clicking the start button.**

If ***YES*** is selected, the following will be displayed in the left window in addition to what was said above:
"Most Perfect Magic Square Mode"

If you are interested in finding a regular magic square (in these sizes), click ***NO***.

## Important!
After clicking stop, you can click start and continue from where the algorithm stopped (i.e. from the generation number with the current parameters that the algorithm stopped).

If you want to start over, you can click the **reset button** - this will reset the visual display cell of the interface, in preparation for a new run with different parameters.


***Only after clicking reset you can enter other parameters and start a new run.***
